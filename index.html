   <h3>My Background</h3>
Hello! My name is Rebecca Arnett and I am currently working on my Master's Degree 
in Library Media Specialist. I am <b> very excited</b> to learn how to create and design 
    a website! I currently work as a fifth and sixth grade ELA and Math teacher. 
    I am eager to become a librarian one day and help students discover a love for reading!
        <br> I have been married to my husband for 22 years this November! Wr have three beautiful children, 
    ages 19, 16, and 4. I get to experience life as a mother of a college student, high school student,
    and preschooler all at once! My life is super busy and crazy at times but I wouldn't have it any other way!
    <br> This is my very first website and I am so excited to be learning this new skill! I am creating it for my 
    course work at <a href="https://www.eku.edu/">Eastern Kentucky Univeristy</a> </td>

     <td width="20%" valign="top" bgcolor="C0C0C0"> My Faith:
     I have been a follower of Jesus Christ 
     since June 16th 2003! I have found that
      when life becomes chaotic and out
     of control, that's when you need only 
     to Be Still and rest 
     in His peace!
