        I spent my childhood playing in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, more specifically in a little town called Salyersville. I still reside in Salyersville
     and probably always will. I have always been one to pave my own way, although I am not recommending it I was married at the young age of 17 to 
     my husband Floyd Arnett II. In our 22 years of marriage we have been blessed with 3 beautiful children. Even though I was married at a young age
     I would not change anything about my journey. I ended up dropping out of highschool, however 3 years later after the birth of my first child I decided
     I wanted better for my family. So I decided to get my GED and got to college. At first I was undecided about my major but not to long into my academic 
     journey God revealed to me that He wanted me to become a teacher. I am starting my 12th year of teaching and I am now working towards a degree in library sciences.
     I attended Morehead State Univeristy which is where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Elementary Education. I then enrolled in University of the Cumberlands where I
     received a Master's Degree in teacher leader. I am currently enrolled in Eastern Kentucky University where I am working towards my Master's Degree in Library Sciences.
